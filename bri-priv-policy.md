# Big Rock Intelligence Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** Mar. 11, 2025

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to Big Rock Intelligence. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information obtained through our application (“App”) and related services.

## 2. Information We Collect
- **User-Provided Data:** When you connect your LinkedIn account, we may collect basic profile information (e.g., name, email, LinkedIn ID) as permitted by LinkedIn’s API scopes.
- **Automatically Collected Data:** We may store logs about how our App is used (e.g., timestamps of requests, error messages) to improve our services.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
- **Provide and Maintain Services:** We use collected information to authenticate you, retrieve necessary LinkedIn data (e.g., profile details), and display it through our App.
- **Improve App Functionality:** We analyze user behavior to fix bugs and improve features.
- **Communications:** We may occasionally send service-related communications, such as system updates or important announcements.

## 4. How We Share Your Information
- **Third-Party Services:** We may share data with trusted service providers (e.g., hosting companies, CRM platforms) to perform tasks on our behalf, subject to confidentiality obligations.
- **Legal Compliance:** If required by law or to protect our rights, we may share information with law enforcement agencies or regulatory bodies.
- **Business Transfers:** If our company is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

## 5. Data Security
We follow industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. International Data Transfers
If you use our App from outside the country where our servers are located, your data may be transferred across international borders subject to applicable data protection laws.

## 7. Your Choices and Rights
- **Access & Correction:** You may request access to or correction of your personal information stored with us.
- **Opt-Out:** If you wish to stop using our services, you may revoke access through your LinkedIn account settings or by contacting us.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 16 (or other relevant age of minority). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Updates will be posted with a new “Effective Date.”
